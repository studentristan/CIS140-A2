Hi! So, here's an explanation of what it is that I did for the proof session:

1. logged in
2. removed sandbox folder from last test run
3. opened .bashrc to pull the commands I dropped in there (listed in sandboxcommand.txt)
4. ran sandbox command
5. failed to put space in to list directory
6. worked on a second try
7. opened image folder to show copied files
8. opened avail-images and web-listing in vim to show output

have fun grading!
